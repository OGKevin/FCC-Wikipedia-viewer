##Wikipedia Viewer

A FCC project (https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-wikipedia-viewer)

As explained on the FCC website the user should be able to do the following:
* I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.
* I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.
